# Interface Monitoring Enhancement

## Overview

Enhanced the discovery tool to **monitor ALL interfaces simultaneously** before detailed analysis, providing users with an informed view of what each interface does.

## What Changed

### Old Workflow
1. User selects device
2. Tool asks which interfaces to use
3. User guesses (no information about what interfaces do)
4. Tool analyzes selected interfaces

**Problem:** Users had to guess which interfaces were useful without seeing what they do.

### New Workflow
1. User selects device
2. **Tool monitors ALL interfaces for 10 seconds** (parallel)
3. **Tool shows summary:** Which interfaces have stylus, buttons, etc.
4. User makes **informed choice** about which to analyze
5. Tool performs detailed analysis on selected interfaces

**Benefit:** Users can see exactly what each interface does before choosing.

## Technical Implementation

### New Functions

#### `_monitor_all_interfaces() -> Dict[int, Dict]`
Monitors all device interfaces simultaneously using threads:
- Opens each interface in a separate thread
- Captures data for 10 seconds
- Returns samples and Report IDs for each interface

#### `_analyze_interface_characteristics(samples) -> Dict[str, bool]`
Analyzes captured samples to determine interface purpose:
- **Coordinates**: High variance in bytes 2-7 (X/Y movement)
- **Buttons**: Bit flag patterns (powers of 2)
- **Pressure**: 16-bit values with significant range
- **Event-based**: Low packet count (only sends when active)

### Enhanced `discover_interfaces()`
Now provides a comprehensive summary:
```
Interface 0:
  Status: ✓ 8 packets
  Report ID(s): [6]
  Characteristics:
    → BUTTON interface (bit patterns detected)
    → Event-based (only sends when active)

Interface 1:
  Status: ✓ 143 packets
  Report ID(s): [7]
  Characteristics:
    → STYLUS interface (coordinates/movement detected)
    → Pressure data detected
```

## Example Output

```
[Step 2] Discovering interfaces...

Found 3 interface(s)

Will monitor ALL interfaces for 10 seconds to see what they do.

Please perform these actions during monitoring:
  • Move stylus around the tablet
  • Touch and lift the stylus
  • Press a tablet button

Press ENTER to start monitoring all interfaces...

Monitoring... perform actions now!

## Benefits

### 1. Better User Experience
- **No guessing**: See what each interface does before choosing
- **Informed decisions**: Understand device architecture
- **Faster setup**: Skip unused interfaces

### 2. Easier Debugging
- **Visual feedback**: Know which interfaces are active
- **Characteristic detection**: Understand interface purpose
- **Report ID discovery**: All Report IDs shown upfront

### 3. Better Device Understanding
- **Multi-interface devices**: See button vs stylus separation (Linux)
- **Single-interface devices**: Identify unified interface (macOS)
- **Unused interfaces**: Skip interfaces with no data

## Detection Algorithms

### Stylus Interface Detection
```python
# High variance in bytes = coordinates changing during movement
for byte_idx in range(2, 8):
    variance = max(values) - min(values)
    if variance > 20:
        has_coordinates = True
```

### Button Interface Detection
```python
# Bit flag patterns (powers of 2)
bit_like = sum(1 for v in unique_values 
               if v in [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128])
if bit_like >= 2:
    has_buttons = True
```

### Pressure Detection
```python
# 16-bit values with significant range
values = [low_byte + (high_byte << 8) for each sample]
if max(values) > 100 and min < max * 0.5:
    has_varying_pressure = True
```

### Event-Based Detection
```python
# Few samples = only sends when active
if len(samples) < 50:
    is_event_based = True
```

## Use Cases

### Multi-Interface Tablet (Linux)
Typical setup:
- **Interface 0**: Buttons only (Report ID 6)
- **Interface 1**: Stylus + pressure + tilt (Report ID 7)
- **Interface 2**: Unused/non-HID

User can see this clearly and choose interfaces 0 and 1.

### Single-Interface Tablet (macOS)
Typical setup:
- **Interface 2**: Everything (buttons, stylus, pressure, tilt)

User sees only one active interface and uses it.

### Complex Device
Some devices have:
- **Interface 0**: Express keys
- **Interface 1**: Touch ring/dial
- **Interface 2**: Stylus
- **Interface 3**: Touch/multi-touch

Now users can identify and select the relevant interfaces.

## Performance

- **Parallel monitoring**: All interfaces monitored simultaneously using threads
- **10-second capture**: Enough time for user to perform various actions
- **Efficient analysis**: Characteristic detection runs quickly on captured samples
- **No blocking**: Threads prevent one slow interface from blocking others
