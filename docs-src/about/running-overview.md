# Running the Application

Strumboli can be run in several different ways, depending on your needs and technical comfort level. This section covers all the different methods for getting Strumboli up and running.

## Choose Your Method

### For Users

**Pre-Built Applications** (Coming Soon)  
The easiest way to run Strumboli. Download a ready-to-use application for your platform, configure it, and double-click to launch. No programming knowledge required.

See [Builds & Installers](/about/builds/) for available distributions.

### For Developers

**[Run from Source](/about/run-from-source/)**  
Clone the Git repository and run the Python service directly. This gives you:
- Access to the latest features and updates

Perfect for developers, contributors, and users who want cutting-edge features.

### For Distributors

**[Building Standalone Applications](/about/builds/)**  
Package Strumboli as a distributable application for macOS, Windows, or Linux. Create installers and distribute to end users who don't want to deal with Python environments.
